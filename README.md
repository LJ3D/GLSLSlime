# GLSLSlime
Rewriting my simulation of slime mold. Inspired by that one video I saw on youtube that one time

# Compiling
Compiling is simple, just run the basic steps you would for building any cmake project.
It may take a while to run `cmake ..` at first, as dependencies are fetched.

NOTE: you may have to manually install some dependencies of GLFW, you should get an error message telling you what package is missing from your system.
